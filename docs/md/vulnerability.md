Vulnerability functions live inside the [Vulnerability Model Development Toolkit](https://bitbucket.org/red-eq/vulnerability-model-development-toolkit/src/master/) (VMDK) repo. Go to this repo for more information on how they were generated and curated. Latest model data is currently stored in `redserver`:

# 2. Development 
## Core modelling decisions and assumptions
### Functions
Vulnerability characteristics of assets are differentiated by country, line of business, coverage, construction code, year built, and rise.

### Calibration
Damage functions were calibrated in iterations. A [validation repository](https://bitbucket.org/red-eq/redcat-eum23-validation/src/main/) was used to track every iteration including reasoning behind, benchmarks, and model changes.

### Tools
VMDK is the main tool through which developers interacted and developed the damage functions. It contains visualization, calibration, and binary generation scripts. VMDK is used to update the damage functions as part of the the 2020 RED/ERN model overhaul. VMDK is a special-purpose toolkit built around the old model vintage and REDCat - our in-house calculation engine.

### Maintenance
VMDK codebase is no longer maintained.

### State of development
Finished
